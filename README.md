# 2019 Winter Protein Growth Time Analysis
Protein time course over growth. This project is stewarded by Sam Payne. The model bacterium (Burkholderia thailandianses) is grown from starting culture, through log growth to stationary phase. 5 time points were taken across this growth curve. Global proteomics measurements were made that show the abundance of all proteins at a given time point. The goal of the project is to analyze this data, find proteins that are differential by time point (growth stage) and then determine why these proteins are regulated. What functions are associated with growth? What functions are associated with stasis? Are there proteins which are tightly regulated which do not have a known function? Additionally, we have the same experiment run on a different bacterium (Rhodopseudomonas palustris). This project could analyze the evolutionary conservation of regulated proteins between the two bacteria.
