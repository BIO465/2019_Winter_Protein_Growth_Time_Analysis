Identifying biological consequences of RAMP sequences

This project is stewarded by Perry Ridge. A RAMP sequence is an RNA motif that exists near the beginning of a mRNA transcript; the function of a RAMP sequence is to slow down ribosome translation of the mRNA. This motif is newly discovered and an algorithm for global identification of the sequence in a genome was recently developed by Dr. Ridge. This project will explore which genes have RAMP sequences and what their function might be. Options include identifying sequences in operon structures, secreted genes, disease associate genes, etc.
